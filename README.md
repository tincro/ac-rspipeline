Tools that I'm working on written in Python

<strong>createDirectory.py</strong> is a project directory creator that I made using Tkinter to learn how to build GUI in Python. I'm continuously looking to improve the code and the tool itself.

<h2>Features for createDirectory.py:</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Creates a project directory that is named in a very organized way</li>
  <li>Copies a template project from Asset drive into correct directory location and renames it</li>
  <li>Process the label name to remove white space and capitalcase the string text</li>
  <li>Will prefix the label name with the year to add unique names in the folder</li>  
  <li>Uses logic to decide where the final directory should go</li>
  <li>Uses color highlighting to show important entry fields in the GUI</li>
  <li>Auto update the listbox depending on the selected parameter for the dropdown</li>
  <li>Button to open the file location in Explorer for quick navigation</li>
  <li>Button to close the GUI window</li>
  <li>Button to create the directory</li>
</ul>
